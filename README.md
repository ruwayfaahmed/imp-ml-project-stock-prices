# MSFT Stock Price Prediction/Forecasting using LSTMs


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
In this project, we built a machine learning model aimed at forecasting the daily stock prices of Microsoft (MSFT). The model's approach involved analyzing historical data, looking back over a sequence of days, and using this information to estimate the future stock price for a specific day. In simpler terms, it's like using past patterns to make educated guesses about what the Microsoft stock price will be tomorrow. This predictive model could be a valuable tool for investors and traders looking to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of stock trading.

## DATA
The dataset used in this project comprises historical Microsoft (MSFT) stock price data obtained from Yahoo Finance. It includes a range of information such as the date of each recorded price, the opening and closing prices for each trading day, the highest and lowest prices during the trading session and trading volume. This data provides a valuable historical perspective on how the MSFT stock has performed over time, enabling us to build models to predict future price movements or analyse past trends for investment insights.

## MODEL 
LSTMs excel at handling time series data by maintaining memory of previous observations and recognizing complex patterns within sequences. They were selected for their capacity to comprehend and forecast sequential data, making them a robust choice for modeling and predicting the intricate dynamics of MSFT stock prices.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
I opted for a combination of manual and random approaches to fine-tune the machine learning model effectively. This hybrid strategy allows for a balance between expert knowledge and exploration of a broader hyperparameter space.

## RESULTS
The results for this were quite good, with a very low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0031643306928042943
